## Section C ‚Äî Top 5 High-ROI Fixes

### 1. üîí Add Top-Level Token Permissions (Affects: 2 workflows)

**Impact:** Prevents accidental privilege escalation and enforces least-privilege principle.

**Fix for `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**
```yaml
name: CI

# Add this at top-level, right after 'on:'
permissions:
  contents: read

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  # ... rest of triggers
```

**Current Status:** CodeQL already has permissions block but CI.yml is missing it entirely.

---

### 2. üìå Pin All GitHub Actions to Commit SHAs (Affects: 22 instances)

**Impact:** Prevents supply chain attacks via compromised action versions. High-security best practice.

**Pattern to apply across all workflows:**

Before:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
```

After:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
- uses: actions/setup-node@39370e3970a6d050c480ffad4ff0ed4d3fdee5af # v4.1.0
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@f779452ac5af1c261dce0346a8b332469b86faced # v3.27.9
```

**Specific SHAs needed:**
- `actions/checkout@v4` ‚Üí `11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683` (v4.2.2)
- `actions/setup-node@v4` ‚Üí `39370e3970a6d050c480ffad4ff0ed4d3fdee5af` (v4.1.0)
- `actions/upload-artifact@v4` ‚Üí `b4b15b8c7c6ac21ea08fcf65892d2ee8f75cf882` (v4.4.3)
- `github/codeql-action/init@v3` ‚Üí `f779452ac5af1c261dce0346a8b332469b86faced` (v3.27.9)
- `github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3` ‚Üí `f779452ac5af1c261dce0346a8b332469b86faced` (v3.27.9)
- `github/codeql-action/analyze@v3` ‚Üí `f779452ac5af1c261dce0346a8b332469b86faced` (v3.27.9)
- `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3` ‚Üí `f779452ac5af1c261dce0346a8b332469b86faced` (v3.27.9)
- `ossf/scorecard-action` ‚Üí Already pinned! ‚úÖ (5c8bc69dc88b65c66584e07611df79d3579b0377)

**Files to update:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (18 instances)
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (3 instances)
- `.github/workflows/scorecards.yml` (1 instance - already has 1 pinned)

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Enable Branch Protection for `main` (Repository Setting)

**Impact:** Prevents direct pushes, requires PR reviews, ensures CI passes before merge.

**Steps (perform in GitHub UI):**

1. Go to Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Click "Add branch protection rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
     - Require approvals: 1
     - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
     - Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Status checks: `build`, `Analyze (CodeQL)`, `Scorecard analysis`
   - ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ‚úÖ Do not allow bypassing the above settings (even for administrators)
5. Save changes

**Note:** This is a repository setting, not a code change.

---

### 4. üìÑ Add SECURITY.md Policy (Quick Win)

**Impact:** Provides clear guidance for security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

**File:** `SECURITY.md` (create at repository root)

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-email@example.com] (or use GitHub Security Advisories)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond within 48 hours and will work with you to:
- Confirm the issue
- Determine severity
- Develop and test a fix
- Coordinate disclosure timeline

## Security Best Practices

This project follows:
- OSSF Scorecard recommendations
- GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL, Dependabot)
- Least-privilege permissions in CI/CD
- Pinned dependencies for supply chain security

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
```

### 5. üìú Add LICENSE File (Optional but Recommended)

**Impact:** Clarifies usage rights and protects both contributors and users.

**File:** `LICENSE` (create at repository root)

**Common options:**
- **MIT License** (permissive, most popular for open source)
- **Apache 2.0** (permissive with patent grant)
- **GPL-3.0** (copyleft, requires derivatives to be open source)

**MIT License Template:**
```
