## PR Summary

This PR adds file access functionality so ChatGPT can read Canvas files without manual downloads.

### Key Features Added

#### 🔍 extract_file Tool
- Download and extract text from Canvas files (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, CSV, MD)
- Configurable modes: text, outline, slides
- Size limits: 15MB max for extraction (configurable via MAX_EXTRACT_MB)
- Character limits: 50k max with truncation and clear notice
- Returns structured blocks + preview text for immediate ChatGPT access
- Security: Uses sanitized CANVAS_TOKEN, no credential leakage

#### 📎 download_file Tool (Updated)
- Download Canvas files as base64 attachments for ChatGPT
- Size-limited: 8MB default, configurable maxSize parameter
- Returns base64-encoded file data for direct attachment
- Replaces previous temp-file approach with in-memory processing
- Use case: Small files that need to be attached to chat

### New Dependencies
- **pdf-parse** - PDF text extraction
- **mammoth** - DOCX text extraction
- **jszip** - PPTX slide text extraction

### New Files
- `src/files.ts` - Core file processing logic
  - getCanvasFileMeta() - Get file metadata from Canvas
  - downloadCanvasFile() - Download file with auth handling
  - extractFileContent() - Extract and structure text content
  - downloadFileAsBase64() - Convert file to base64 attachment
- `tests/files.extract.test.ts` - Extraction tests
- `tests/files.download.test.ts` - Download tests
- `tests/files.docx.test.ts` - DOCX extraction tests
- `tests/files.pptx.test.ts` - PPTX extraction tests
- `tests/files.text.test.ts` - Plain text/CSV tests
- `tests/files.disallowed.test.ts` - Unsupported file type tests
- `scripts/smoke-files.sh` - Structural validation script

### Updated Files
- `src/http.ts` - Register both tools with proper schemas and error handling
- `src/config.ts` - Added getSanitizedCanvasToken() helper
- `scripts/smoke-public.sh` - Extended with optional FILE_ID testing
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated for file testing support
- `package.json` - Added new dependencies

### Testing Coverage
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with mocked axios (zero network calls)
- ✅ PDF extraction success (mocked pdf-parse)
- ✅ DOCX extraction + truncation behavior
- ✅ PPTX slide extraction + octet-stream fallback
- ✅ Plain text + CSV handling
- ✅ File size rejection (>15MB)
- ✅ Unsupported content type handling
- ✅ Base64 attachment success
- ✅ Size limit enforcement
- ✅ Complete isolation from Canvas API calls

### Security & Limits
- **Size Protection**: Configurable limits prevent memory issues
- **Content Validation**: Strict MIME type checking with allow-list
- **Auth Handling**: Consistent use of sanitized CANVAS_TOKEN
- **Error Logging**: Structured Canvas error events with logger.error()
- **MIME Allow-List**: Explicit validation with allowed types
- **Size Validation**: Mismatch warnings with 1KB tolerance

### Recent Code Review Feedback (CodeRabbit)

The PR has undergone comprehensive code review with the following improvements:

**✅ Implemented:**
- MIME allow-list for strict content type validation
- Size mismatch validation in downloadCanvasFile()
- Standardized error messages with consistent formatting
- JSDoc coverage >80% with comprehensive documentation
- Replaced all console.* calls with logger.*
- 4 new test files for comprehensive coverage
- Enhanced smoke scripts with non-fatal file testing

**🔴 Outstanding Issue:**
- Dead code cleanup needed (lines 586-724 in src/http.ts) - orphaned from refactoring

## Usage Flow

1. **Discovery**: list_modules → list_files_from_modules → get fileId
2. **Reading**: extract_file with fileId → get structured text for analysis
3. **Attachment**: download_file with fileId → get base64 for chat attachment

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ extract_file and download_file appear in tools/list
- ✅ PDF/DOCX/PPTX extraction working (validated via tests)
- ✅ Size limits and unsupported file types return safe errors
- ✅ No real network calls in tests
- ✅ Smoke scripts provide validation and preview functionality
- ✅ MIME type security with allow-list
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- ✅ Standardized error handling
- 🔴 Dead code cleanup pending (final step before merge)

## Next Steps

1. Remove orphaned dead code (lines 586-724 in src/http.ts)
2. Verify all CI checks pass
3. Final review and approval
4. Merge to main branch

## Conclusion

PR #21 is **nearly production-ready** with comprehensive file handling capabilities, excellent test coverage, robust security measures, and thorough documentation. One final cleanup of orphaned code is needed before merge.
