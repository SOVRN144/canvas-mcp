# PR21 CI Failure Analysis - Complete Summary

## Issue
PR #21 (feature/files-extract-download) has failing CI smoke tests:
- `CI / smoke (pull_request)` - Failing after 54s
- `CI / smoke (push)` - Failing after 43s

## Analysis Completed ✅

### Root Cause Identified
The smoke test in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lines 82-102) makes three HTTP requests to the MCP server:
1. **initialize** (line 86-90) - ✅ Has `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` header
2. **tools/list** (line 93-96) - ❌ Missing `Accept` header
3. **tools/call** (line 98-102) - ❌ Missing `Accept` header

The MCP server requires the `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` header on **ALL** requests, not just initialization. Without this header, the server returns:
```
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Not Acceptable: Client must accept both application/json and text/event-stream"},"id":null}
```

### Testing Methodology
1. Checked out PR21 branch (`feature/files-extract-download`)
2. Built the project: `npm ci && npm run build`
3. Ran all unit tests: `npm test` - ✅ All 35 tests passed
4. Started server in CI mode: `LOG_LEVEL=error NODE_ENV=test node dist/http.js`
5. Reproduced the failure by running smoke test commands without Accept header - ❌ HTTP 406
6. Verified fix by adding Accept header to all requests - ✅ PASSED

## Fix Applied ✅

### Changes Made
Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to add the missing `Accept` header:

**Line 95** (tools/list):
```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SID" \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \  # <-- ADDED
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | jq . >/dev/null
```

**Line 101** (tools/call):
```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: $SID" \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \  # <-- ADDED
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo","arguments":{"text":"ci ping"}}}' \
  | jq -r '.result.content[0].text' | grep -q '^ci ping$'
```

### Verification Results
✅ Local smoke test simulation: **PASSED**
✅ All unit tests (35 tests): **PASSED**
✅ Impact: Minimal (2 lines added)
